# TODO: Fix Last Certificate Image Visibility in about.html

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Edit style.css to increase right padding for .cert-grid-scrollable from 80px to 120px
- [x] Update responsive media queries: for max-width 768px, change right padding to 80px; for max-width 480px, change to 70px
- [ ] Test the changes by opening about.html in a browser to ensure the last image is fully visible

## Notes
- The issue is that the right scroll button may be overlapping or insufficient padding is causing the last certificate image not to be fully visible.
- Increasing padding provides more space for the scrollable content.
